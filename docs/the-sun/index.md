# The Sun

The sun shines for all. [[Ossu]] is not merely the god of the sun, he *is* the sun. His rays of light bring life and joy to the people of Wahda and banish the horrors of the dark. He is life, he is light, he is joy and truth. His arcane might is the source of all magic. 

Without the sun, without Ossu, you would be nothing.

The black sky on moonless nights is a reminder of that undeniable fact.

So it comes as no surprise that every culture on Wahda worships the sun in their own way. The sun shines for all.
