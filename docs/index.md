# Starless Sky

There is just the sun, the moon and us.

## In the Darkness Burns a Lonely Fire
Pilgrims crowd desperately around the campfire, casting long shadows into the desert night. The relentless heat made the journey impossible by day, but on this night, they also cannot move on.

The lonely fire flickers and struggles. It is the night of the dark moon, and the sky is starless.

## World Without Stars
The moonless nights are dark and the world grows colder. Decay dominates the edges of civilization, and at the center of the world, in Alhir-Alhar, scholars desperately seek answers under still oppressive heat. The people of Wahda place all their hopes on the coronation of the new queen of the twin city to turn the fate of the world for the better. The pilgrimage to the Temple of the Sun next year will be the largest Wahda has ever seen.

But this year, the journey is quiet and contemplative. Even in the tents along the path, normally places of joy, light, and celebration, fragments of dark prophecies and rumors are whispered:

> The first son of Wahda, broken on the altar of the false god:
> Alhir-Alhar will burn,
> Shay will fall,
> Raupaso Vura will drown,
> The heart overrun.
> When the traitor returns.

## Character Creation
Due to the setting, various classes and spells are banned or reflavored. These include: Circle of the Stars Druid, Dimension Door, Gate, Crown of Stars, etc.
  
The setting focuses on humans. Humans, half-elves, halflings, and gnomes are playable without problems, while more exotic races are a rare sight but can be included. Elves are banned.

## TeWhanga
TeWhanga glitters like the sea under the sun, where dunes meet water. Climbing one of the thousand white towers adorned with colorful mosaics in the harbor city, one can see for miles into the blue desert of the sea and the yellow desert of the land. Guilds haggle in deep shaded alleys, ships rock in the harbor, caravans arrive and leave the city. The glittering city is the gateway to the world: There is constant movement, trade, and adventure.

## Gahere-Rere
Gahere-Rere is also known as the jungle continent, the original home of the half-elves. However, it is less a continent and more a collection of larger and smaller tropical islands (Gahere) and a vast, dense jungle-covered, and almost unexplored island (Rere). Legends surround the center of Rere, speaking of lights in the sky and treasures beyond imagination. Thus, the coastal cities of Gahere attract adventurers and fortune seekers from all over the world, as well as those who wish to relieve them of the heavy burden of gold coins in various ways.

## The Wildlands
The Wildlands are a continent on the southern hemisphere of Wahda. Cruel and fierce, civilization here has been pushed back by wild animals, monsters, and relentless weather to a few harbor cities. The Wildlands are unpredictable, with swamps and dusty, dead tree-strewn landscapes alternating. Few expeditions ever venture into the heartland, and even fewer return. It is said there is nothing to find here: no ruins, no hidden cities, nothing of value. In the Wildlands, nothing grows, the Wildlands feed no one, and they show no mercy. One day, the inhabitants of the harbor cities say, the Wildlands will rise and march over Wahda, destroying everything in their path, and not even Ossu and Grumma could stop the land and its beasts in their rampage and wrath.

## Legends and Undiscovered Places
Wahda is full of legends and undiscovered places. Places that wish to remain secret or are so remote they are simply not accessible. Stories are told of an island that does not want to be found. Deep realms, cut off from the light of Ossu. Figures moving in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike. The brave, the foolhardy, and the desperate venture into these forgotten corners of Wahda, seeking fame, fortune, or answers to the world's oldest questions.
