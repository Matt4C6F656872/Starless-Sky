There is just the sun, the moon and us.

## In the dark, a lonely fire burns
Pilgrims crowd desperately around the campfire, casting long shadows into the desert night. The relentless heat made the journey impossible by day, but on this night, moving on is impossible.

The lonely fire flickers and struggles. It is the night of the black sky, and the sky is starless.

## World Without Stars
The moonless nights are dark and the world grows colder. Decay dominates the edges of civilization, and at the center of the world, in Alhir-Alhar, scholars desperately seek answers under still oppressive heat. The people of Wahda place all their hopes on the coronation of the new queen of the twin city to turn the fate of the world for the better. The pilgrimage to the Temple of the Sun next year will be the largest Wahda has ever seen.

But this year, the journey is quiet and contemplative. Even in the tents along the path, normally places of joy, light, and celebration, fragments of dark prophecies and rumors are whispered:

> The first son of Wahda, broken on the altar of the false god:  
> Alhir-Alhar will burn,  
> Shay will fall,  
> Raupaso Vura will drown,  
> The heart overrun.  
> When the traitor returns.

## Legends and Undiscovered Places
Wahda is full of legends and undiscovered places. Places that wish to remain secret or are so remote they are simply not accessible. Stories are told of an island that does not want to be found. Deep realms, cut off from the light of Ossu. Figures moving in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike. The brave, the foolhardy, and the desperate venture into these forgotten corners of Wahda, seeking fame, fortune, or answers to the world's oldest questions.
