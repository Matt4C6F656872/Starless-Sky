The firekeeper is a mysterious hooded figure from ancient days who keeps Ossu's fire alive in the night. Everybody who traveled during moonless nights has uttered prayers to them in hopes of finding a well-lit and secure camp in the dark.

They are also the patron saint of those who are responsible to keep candles and bonfires lit and the hearth warm - be it in palace, castle or home.

He is usually shown keeping a big, black dog away that is said to represent the dark.
