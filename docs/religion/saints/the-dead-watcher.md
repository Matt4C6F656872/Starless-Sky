The Dead Watcher is prayed to by people of the Far North. It is hoped that he watches over the dead in the crypts where Ossu's light cannot reach.

The different lands of the Far North have different legends and stories about this figure and why he might be watching.

His statues on crypts and graveyards are commonly depicting him surrounded by skeletons, with his face obscured.
