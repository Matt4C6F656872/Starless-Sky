Only a handful of people know of this name found in the archives deep under Alhar. It is recorded that The Sunforged has been made saint in a forgotten age, but not much else is known.

On the 5th day of Winter in the year 201 of the Snowroc Clan, unbeknownst the the world at large, a blueprint was found by the dwarven thief Brynn:

> A weapon of something called "The Sunforged". Massive energies would be necessary to fire a single shot from this 3 ton weapon made from metal you never heard of. It seems to be a side arm.

What became of Brynn or the blueprint is unknown.
