A saint worshipped by the giants of the Eastern Mountains.

They Who Walk the Paths is said to be a giant who knows and walks all the paths of the great desert: Above and below, even those yet to be discovered.

When giants go on journeys to trade goods, they pray to They Who Walk the Paths to guide their caravans and protect their mounts and wares.
