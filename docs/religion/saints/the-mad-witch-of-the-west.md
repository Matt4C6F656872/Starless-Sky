The Mad Witch of the West is prayed to by those who feel misunderstood and treated unfairly.

The Mad Witch of the West is unique among the saints: The title is passed down through generations. What exactly it takes to become the next Mad Witch is a mystery to all but the current one. Alhar has accepted this tradition so long ago that the reasons are buried under millennia of history.

It is said that the current Mad Witch resides in the Shadowed Lands.
