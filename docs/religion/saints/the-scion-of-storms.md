The Scion of Storms is worshipped by those who seek to destroy unjust order.

Long ago, an elf by the name of Neriya found herself desperate and close to death. Instead of giving in and accepting her fate, she became the first follower of Shia, the Thousandfold Sea and destroyed all that opposed her.

Among the orks and arkharaaths, she is feared as Nerka, while the people of Mika who bear the mark of sin pray for her return. People of the North say she prowls the wilds together with the Nightmare Hunter whenever a storm rages through the deep woods.
