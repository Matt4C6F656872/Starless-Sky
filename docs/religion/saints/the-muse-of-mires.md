The Muse of Mires is a woman said to currently walk the Northern Lands in disguise. Little is known about her, but artists all over the world credit her for their best works.

The one time she appeared publicly in Alhar to be made a saint was three years ago. Nobody, not even the Daughter of the Sun or any of her guard, were allowed to see her face. Before disappearing, she let the world know that she created but one work. Just like her identity, the title remained a mystery.

Struggling and successful artists alike treat women well - they could be The Muse of Mires in disguise.
