A saint worshipped by the giants of the Eastern Mountains.

He Whose Steps Loosens Stones is asked for strength to start new journeys, work and projects. He is also responsible for avalanches, making the Eastern Mountains treacherous and journeying into the Smallfolk Kingdom dangerous.

When the giant caravans arrive with their marble and stone and start offering their services as architects and builders, He Whose Steps Loosens Stones judges the quality of their work.
