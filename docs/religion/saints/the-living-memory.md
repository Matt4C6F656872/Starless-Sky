A saint worshipped by the Halfelves of Gahere-Rere.

Deep in the jungle continent of Gahere-Rere, the presence of The Living Memory resides. There is much speculation about its nature: While the scholars of Alhar and even some of the Learned People of the North believe it to be the accumulated knowledge and memory of the land itself gifted consciousness by the gods, rumors of the Halfelves speak of an ancient Elf watching over them. 

Many have tried to find it or even commune with it in hopes to shed light on the Halfcurse and the legacy of the Elves.
