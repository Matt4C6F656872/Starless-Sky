A saint worshipped by the giants of the Eastern Mountains.

She Who Watches the Sky is a stone formation in the form of a female giant at a cliffside in the eastern mountains, appearing to forever watch the sky. Giants consult her wisdom to divine the weather before undertaking journeys. The scholars of Alhar have accepted her as a saint for her dedication and ever watchfulness, not once averting her gaze from the glory and might of Ossu.

What signs she might be waiting for is unknown.
