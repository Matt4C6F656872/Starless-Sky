A saint worshipped by those seeking lost knowledge and those who want to remember better days.

Many cities and villages claim to possess parts of The Relic. He is said to be one of the first saints, blessed by Grumma shortly after the world was forged. When he died, his body was scattered across all of Wahda to even the most distant parts of the world to serve as a reminder for the God of Earth's protection.

At the end of time, he will return and fight along the gods once more. To prepare for this, relic seekers scour the land in search of his remains.
