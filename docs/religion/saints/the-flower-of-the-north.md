"The Flower of the North", also known as the "man closest to the sun", was made a saint by the scholars of Alhar while serving as the guard of the Daughter of the Sun. Even before that, his deeds in the Shadowed Lands were rumored to be reason enough to declare him holy.

Currently, he is serving his 100 days of solitude atop The Vale and will emerge as a Sharat for a final patrol in the desert before returning to the Far North.

The similarities to the adventure novel hero "Kurt von Lichtbad" are striking and a welcome reason for his comrades to teasingly call him "Saint von Lichtbad."
