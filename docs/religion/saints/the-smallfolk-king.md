The legendary king of Halflings and Gnomes. Long ago he dared to steal from Grumma as a joke and got away with it. With the riches of the God of Earth, he founded his empire.

The Halflings and Gnomes never forgot and thank their king for bountiful harvest and good ideas. While they await his return, they hold feasts in his honor and try to get his attention with Dares and interesting inventions.

When Haflings go on their "Dares", they pray to the Smallfolk King for luck, fun and adventure. Gnomes thank him for flashes of inspiration and ideas that are just too good not to steal from others.
