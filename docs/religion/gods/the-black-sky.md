Worshipped by the Cult of the Black Sky as a god, this entity is also called "The Traitor" and "The Savior". 

While the ultimate goals and motives of the cult are unknown, an ancient prophecy speaks of the end of the gods themselves and the ruin of the world upon their return to Wahda.

Artifacts associated with this malevolent entity seem to function normally even on moonless nights. This contradicts the dogma that all Ossu is the source of all magic; those artifacts are deemed heretical and their possession punishable by death.
