## Ancient Ruins

Some think that there are reasons beyond our understanding for this continent to exist. The more you warn them, the more they seem to be drawn towards it.

Rumors speak of gigantic fallen cities that rival even Alhir-Alhar in size and buried secrets. Places of unknown powers fueling long forgotten wars. Locked away beasts that could ravage countries, and marvels that rival the might of the gods themselves. Apparitions that desperately try to tell you something of importance, before being consumed by dead storms.

The people of Mika are quick to trade with these types, because those who bear the mark of sin know: These people will wander out into the Badlands, never to be seen again.
