The Badlands are a dead continent on the southern hemisphere. Completely uninhabitable except for a small few villages at the coast, even its name is dead and forgotten.

Strange creatures roam these corrupted lands, defying all logic and reason. 

Those born in the badlands bear the mark of sin: An inverted sun that makes them unable to leave the continent. They desperately hold the last bastions of civilization until the day they hope their own twisted prophecy comes true.

Those insane enough to travel to the badlands usually end up in [[mika|Mika]].
