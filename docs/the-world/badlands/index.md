The Badlands are a continent on the southern hemisphere. To describe it as being *dead* would not paint the full picture: Completely uninhabitable except for a small few villages at the coast, even its name is forgotten. It is said there is nothing to find here: no ruins, no hidden cities, nothing of value. In the Badlands, nothing grows, they feed no one, and they show no mercy. 

 Rarely, when the air is clean and one can see far, insane structures resembling buildings seem to grow from the Badlands. Any attempts to find them or pinpoint their location from afar have failed. Strange things roam these corrupted lands, defying all logic and reason.

Those born in the badlands bear the mark of sin: An inverted sun that makes them unable to leave the continent. They desperately hold the last bastions of civilization until the day they hope their own twisted prophecy comes true:

One day the Badlands themselves will rise and march over Wahda, destroying everything in their path, and not even Ossu and Grumma could stop the land and its beasts in their wrath.

Those insane enough to travel to the badlands usually end up in [[mika|Mika]]. From there they start expeditions into the heartland, never to be seen again.
