In [[The Lost Mountains]], nine pillars of stone stand and pierce the sky. When the world was young, [[Starless-Sky/docs/religion/gods/grumma|Grumma]] accepted a challenge by a mortal there and raised these pillars for the audience. They battled for ten days, and the applause bore thunder, and to this day the mountains remember and celebrate this display of strength with rockslides and earthquakes.

The reclusive people who live deep in the mountains tell stories that the heat of battle pushed back the cold and even Ossu himself came to observe the spectacle, and it was the first time these mountains were free of the deadly grip of ice and snow. Beautiful and full of life were green valleys, rare and colorful flowers bloomed and life was good. They say that the mountains have not forgotten and long for this time while glittering under Ossu's winter sun.
