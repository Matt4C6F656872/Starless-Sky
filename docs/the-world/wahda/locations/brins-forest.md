Brin's Forest is a rock formation in the form of trees in the desert. It is a welcome sight for pilgrims, spending shade and signaling that they already made a third of the way to the Temple of the Sun.

Almost all of these rocks form the image of a forest: While some of them display branches and closely resemble trees with a canopy made of stone, while others are nothing more than giant stone columns stretching towards the sun.

The forest was discovered a long time ago by a pilgrim named Brin, when sand and stone parted beneath his feet as he prayed along the path. Nobody exactly knows how these rocks formed, but many scholars guess it was Grumma's work trying to impress Shia. Others take it as an omen for a different prophecy. 

When standing atop the Vale, one has a good view of the forest. But pilgrims lighting their campfire within the forest will be hidden even from the most watchful eyes and good intentions. For this reason, the holy knights of the Vale regularily patrol the forest to rescue lost pilgrims drawn into the natural wonder.
