In Dante's Inferno, the sinners guilty of violence are punished in the Seventh Circle of Hell. This circle is divided into three rings, each dealing with a different form of violence:

1. The Violent Against Others - These are the murderers, tyrants, and robbers. They are submerged in a river of boiling blood, with the depth they are submerged corresponding to the severity of their crimes.

2. The Violent Against Themselves - These are the suicides. They have been transformed into gnarled, thorny bushes, constantly fed upon by harpies (mythical bird-like creatures with human faces).

3. The Violent Against God, Art, and Nature - This ring contains blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers. The blasphemers lie in a desert of burning sand, while the sodomites and usurers are assaulted by fiery flakes of fire raining down from the sky.

Some notable figures punished in this circle include:

The punishments in the Seventh Circle are designed to reflect the perversion of the natural order that violence represents. The sinners are trapped in a landscape of fire, blood, and thorns - a twisted reflection of the world they once inhabited.
