## Wahda (Desert)

Wahda, the great desert: It stretches from the west of the continent to the east, where the dunes and sand turn into hills and stones, ending in a great mountain range. Scholars argue whether the continent gave the desert its name, or it gave the continent and the world theirs. In the middle of the desert lies the Temple of the Sun, the destination of the Rhilat, the pilgrimage.

  

But the rest of the desert is far from dead: Oasis cities, traveling merchants on exotic mounts, sometimes even giants descending from the mountains, carrying heavy loads on secret paths. Numerous buried temples and tombs, hidden or lost treasures, bandits, and mysterious phenomena can be foundâ€”or find the travelers and adventurers. No one goes into the desert without reason, but there are enough reasons besides the Rhilat to go into the desert or cross it.
