# The Moon

At night, the moon reflects the light of the sun towards Wahda, illuminating everything in a soft, silvery glow.

It might be Ossus arcane might that is the source of all magic - but it is Akadi, the goddess of the moon, who teaches the people of Wahda how to weild it.

Beware the nights in which even the moon does not shine.
