The glittering city is the gateway to the world: There is constant movement, trade, and adventure.</p>"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#general-information","title":"General Information","text":"Field Details Continent Wahda Region South Country/Empire / Founded Unknown Population 780.000 Races (%) Humans 40 Halflings 23 Gnomes 17 Halfelves 15 Other 5"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#geography","title":"Geography","text":"Field Details Climate Terrain Major Landmarks - Landmark 1 - Landmark 2 - Landmark 3 Natural Resources"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#governance","title":"Governance","text":"Field Details Government Type Current Leader Major Factions/Organizations - Faction 1 - Faction 2 - Faction 3"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#economy","title":"Economy","text":"Field Details Major Industries Trade - Imports - Exports Currency"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#military","title":"Military","text":"Field Details Defense Forces - Army - Navy - Special Units Major Fortifications - Fortification 1 - Fortification 2"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#society-and-culture","title":"Society and Culture","text":"Field Details Languages Spoken Religions Practiced Festivals and Holidays - Festival 1 - Festival 2 Education Notable Architecture"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#history","title":"History","text":"Field Details Founding Myth/Legend Significant Historical Events - Event 1 - Event 2 - Event 3"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#important-personalities","title":"Important Personalities","text":"Field Details Historical Figures - Figure 1 - Figure 2 Current Influential Figures - Figure 1 - Figure 2"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#miscellaneous","title":"Miscellaneous","text":"Field Details Common Sayings/Mottos Legends and Myths Local Cuisine Notable Laws/Customs"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/tewhanga/#map-and-images","title":"Map and Images","text":""},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/the-paths/","title":"The paths","text":"<p>placeholder</p>"},{"location":"the-world/wahda/locations/the-vale/","title":"The Vale","text":"<p>Stronghold of the Sharat, overlooking the endless desert.</p> <p>Burned into the rock at the base of the stronghold is one of the five known Eternal Circles of Truth.
